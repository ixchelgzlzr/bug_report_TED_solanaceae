I kind of lost track of what we did in the previous version but basically I expanded all the way out to the full extant taxon set. In some cases, I kept the old taxon (e.g. I. cyanueum) instead of the one in the "160" set because I couldn't see why we switched (e.g., to I. amicorum). I could have kept both but we still want to keep the dataset small. So if there was just one Iochroma in the "160", I just kept one in this dataset. I did keep the 'final' fossil selection that was in "oldtaxa_newseeds" so the main difference in this dataset is the addition of all of the extant taxa. We also worked to fill in every possible ? and double checked the scoring.  

Oh and it's still labeled continuous log but it is not logged at all. it's just to avoid messing up the scripts
