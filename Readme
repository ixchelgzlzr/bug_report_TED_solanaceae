The code is modular, each component of the model has it's own folder.

Please run the analyses from the main directory. All the analysis are called from the folder headers. You can modify outputs and submodels there

# to run the TED analysis including continuos data:
rb headers/MCMC/model_TED_w_backbone_const090624.Rev 

# to run the TED analysis without continuos data:
rb headers/MCMC/model_TED_w_backbone_const_nocont_090624.Rev 

# to run the unrooted analysis with all the data:
rb headers/MCMC/unrooted_all_data_mole_scaler.Rev 


----------
NOTE: if you modify the seed, you might encounter that the analysis has a hard time to find a starting tree (due to the constraints) and prints something like:

"Drawing new initial states ... 
   Could not compute lnProb for node 'timetree': lnProb = -inf
   ((((((f_1993_5544[&index=126]:15.544573,(Heteranthi...
"

I have noticed that when this happens, rb internally changes the branch lengths of terminals, often making fossils extant or viceversa... which is a totally undesirable behaviour.
I believe this is a separate issue, and the way I work around it is killing the analysis until it initializes in the first attempt.
